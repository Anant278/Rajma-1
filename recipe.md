The steps to make rajma are - 

        i) Rinse for a couple of times and then soak 1 cup rajma (kidney beans) in enough water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.

        ii) Next day discard the soaked water. Drain and rinse the soaked beans for a few times in running water.

        iii) Again drain all the water and add the rinsed kidney beans in a 3 litre pressure cooker.

        iv) Add 3.5 to 4 cups of water and stir. Pressure cook the rajma for 18 to 20 whistles or for about 15 to 20 minutes. Time of cooking will vary depending on the quality and   age of rajma.

        v) When the kidney beans are cooking, you can chop 1 large onion (¾ to 1 cup finely chopped onion), 2 large tomatoes (1 cup finely chopped tomatoes) and make the crushed ginger+garlic+green chili paste. You need to crush or grind 1 inch ginger, 5 to 6 small garlic cloves or 3 to 4 medium garlic cloves & 1 to 2 green chilies to a paste in a mortar-pestle or a small grinder.
        
        vi) When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, open the lid. Check if the rajma is cooked or not by eating or pressing a bean with your fingers. The cooked beans should not have a bite to them. The rajma beans should be completely cooked. If they are not cooked completely, then pressure cook again adding some water if required for some minutes.

        vii) Heat 3 tablespoons butter or 2 tablespoons butter + 1 tablespoon oil in another pot or pan or kadai. Keep the heat to low or medium-low.

        viii) Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds first and let them crackle & get browned.

        ix) Then add the finely chopped onions.

        x) Stir and begin to sauté them on medium-low to medium heat.

        xi) Keep on stirring the onions while sauteing them, for uniform cooking and also so that they don’t get burnt. Take care not to burn them as this will impart bitter tones to the rajma curry.

        xii) Light browning of the onions is also fine.

        xiii) Sauté the onions till they are caramelized or golden browned.

        xiv) Lower heat and add the crushed ginger-garlic-chilli paste.

        xv) Stir and sauté for 5 to 10 seconds on a low heat or until the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.

        xvi) Add the finely chopped tomatoes.

        xvii) Mix very well.
        
        xviii) Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until the tomatoes become soft on a medium-low to medium heat.

        xix) Add all the spice powders one by one – ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder, a pinch of asafoetida (hing) and ½ teaspoon garam masala powder.
        
        xx) Mix again very well.

        xxi) Continue to sauté the whole masala base until the fat starts leaving the sides of masala on a medium-low heat.

        xxii) Use a slotted spoon or a strainer and remove the rajma beans and add them to the masala. You can also strain the rajma first and set it aside. Set the stock (the water in which the kidney beans were cooked) also aside.

        xxiii) Stir and sauté for a minute

        xxiv) Take 2 cups from the stock or a mixture of stock+water and add.

        xxv) Add salt as required.

        xxvi) Stir the whole rajma curry mixture.

        xxvii) On a low to medium-low heat, simmer without a lid for 10 to 12 minutes or more until the rajma masala thickens slightly. The rajma curry should not be watery.

        xxviii)  Mash a few rajma beans with the spoon. This helps to thicken the rajma curry.

        xxix) Continue to simmer until you get a medium consistency in the curry.

        xxx) Do stir at intervals when the rajma masala is simmering.

        xxxi) The Punjabi rajma masala has to thicken and the curry has to be of the right consistency, which is neither too thick nor thin.

        xxxii) Then add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) and 2 to 3 tablespoons cream (low-fat cream). Mix very well & simmer for 30 seconds to 1 minute. If using heavy whipping cream, then just add 1 tablespoon of it.
